## What it is

A basic warmup exercise. Simple, practice oriented, clone of the Netflix Homepage. Built with:

- Look pretty, that's about it :-)

## Learning Points

- Styling Tables
- Tabs with Javascript
- Positioning

I might add the other pages on the Netflix website if I ever come back to refactor ^-^
